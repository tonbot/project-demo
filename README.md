# Overview

As a software engineer in training, I am constantly building foundational skills that will support larger projects in the future. This simple web application was created to reinforce my understanding of PHP and server-side scripting, as well as the basic workflow of setting up and running a web-based project.

This software is a basic PHP script that outputs “Hello World” to the screen. While minimal, it serves as a stepping stone in my journey to mastering web development technologies.

The purpose of this project is to practice server-side scripting with PHP, test my development environment, and confirm I can execute code from a browser via a local or remote server.
